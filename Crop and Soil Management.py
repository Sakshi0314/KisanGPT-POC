crop_info = {
    "Wheat": {
        "Description": "Wheat is a cereal grain originally from the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopian Highlands, but now cultivated worldwide. It is the third most-produced cereal after maize and rice, and it is a staple food for many cultures.",
        "Optimal Growth Conditions": "Temperature: 15-20°C, Rainfall: 30-100 cm, Soil Type: Loamy",
        "Common Diseases": "Rust, Blight, Powdery Mildew"
    },
    "Rice": {
        "Description": "Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or less commonly Oryza glaberrima (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia.",
        "Optimal Growth Conditions": "Temperature: 20-30°C, Rainfall: 100-200 cm, Soil Type: Clayey",
        "Common Diseases": "Blast, Brown Spot, Sheath Blight"
    },
    "Maize": {
        "Description": "Maize, also known as corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. It has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice.",
        "Optimal Growth Conditions": "Temperature: 18-27°C, Rainfall: 50-100 cm, Soil Type: Well-drained loamy",
        "Common Diseases": "Corn Smut, Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus, Northern Corn Leaf Blight"
    },
    "Soybean": {
        "Description": "Soybean is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses. Soybeans can be processed into soy protein, tofu, soy milk, and various other products.",
        "Optimal Growth Conditions": "Temperature: 20-30°C, Rainfall: 50-75 cm, Soil Type: Loamy, well-drained",
        "Common Diseases": "Soybean Rust, Root Rot, Soybean Cyst Nematode"
    },
    "Cotton": {
        "Description": "Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of cotton plants of the genus Gossypium. The fiber is most often spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft, breathable textile.",
        "Optimal Growth Conditions": "Temperature: 21-30°C, Rainfall: 50-100 cm, Soil Type: Loamy, sandy loam",
        "Common Diseases": "Boll Rot, Wilt Disease, Leaf Spot"

    "Loamy": {
        "Description": "Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay, and it has ideal properties for farming. It is rich in nutrients, has good drainage, and retains moisture well.",
        "Nutrient Content": "High in nutrients, good water retention",
        "Suitability for Crops": "Suitable for almost all crops, including wheat, maize, and vegetables."
    },
    "Clayey": {
        "Description": "Clayey soil has a high clay content and retains a lot of water. It is sticky when wet and can be very hard when dry.",
        "Nutrient Content": "High in nutrients but poor drainage",
        "Suitability for Crops": "Good for rice, can be improved for other crops with proper management."
    },
    "Sandy": {
        "Description": "Sandy soil has a high proportion of sand particles and is well-drained. It warms up quickly in the spring but has low nutrient content and poor water retention.",
        "Nutrient Content": "Low in nutrients, poor water retention",
        "Suitability for Crops": "Suitable for crops like carrots, potatoes, and peanuts which do not require a lot of nutrients and water."
    },
    "Silt": {
        "Description": "Silt soil is composed of fine particles and has a smooth texture. It retains moisture better than sandy soil and is more fertile but can be prone to erosion.",
        "Nutrient Content": "Moderate to high in nutrients, good water retention",
        "Suitability for Crops": "Suitable for a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, and vegetables."
    },
    "Peaty": {
        "Description": "Peaty soil is dark brown or black in color, soft, easily compressed due to its high water content, and rich in organic matter. It can retain a lot of moisture and is often acidic.",
        "Nutrient Content": "High in organic matter, poor nutrient availability unless managed",
        "Suitability for Crops": "Suitable for crops like shrubs, legumes, and root crops; can be improved for other crops with proper management and liming."
